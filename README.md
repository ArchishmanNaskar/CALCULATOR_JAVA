# CALCULATOR_JAVA
Tried to make a basic calculator only using basic java.
This is basic calculator works just as good as any phone calculator.
Operates with +,-,*,/, and().
Uses BODMAS Rule.
When Running the the code plese give input carefully(tuough it has a very fine exception handling. If input is wrong it will give error massage until you put a proper input.).
Press enter after every input just as you do while running code in any IDE or Terminal.
